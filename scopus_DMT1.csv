High-resolution HLA class II haplotyping, SNP genotyping, and T1D-genetic risk score (T1D-GRS) were also evaluated.Results: Eight of the ninety-nine EOT1D participants carried a potentially deleterious rare variant in a MODY gene. Rare variants affected five genes: GCK (n=1), HNF1B (n=2), HNF4A (n=1), PDX1 (n=2), and RFX6 (n=2). At diagnosis, these children had a mean age of 3.0 years, a mean HbA1c of 10.5%, a detectable C-peptide in 5/8, and a positive islet autoantibody in 6/7. Children with MODY variants tend to exhibit a lower number of pancreatic autoantibodies and a lower fasting C-peptide compared to EOT1D without MODY rare variants. They also carried at least one high-risk DR3-DQ2 or DR4-DQ8 haplotype and exhibited a T1D-GRS similar to the other individuals in the EOT1D cohort, but higher than healthy controls.Conclusions: WES found potentially deleterious rare variants in MODY genes in 8.1% of EOT1D, occurring in the context of a T1D genetic background. Such genetic variants may contribute to disease precipitation by a β-cell dysfunction mechanism. This supports the concept of different endotypes of T1D, and WES at T1D onset may be a prerequisite for the implementation of precision therapies in children with autoimmune diabetes. © 2024 Andreia Fiúza Ribeiro et al.","C.

Adult-onset type 1 diabetes is now known to represent more overall cases than childhood onset, but it is not known whether DR15-DQ6 is protective in older-adult-onset type 1 diabetes. We sought to quantify DR15-DQ6 protection against type 1 diabetes as age of onset increased. Methods: In two independent cohorts we assessed the proportion of type 1 diabetes cases presenting through the first 50 years of life with DR15-DQ6, compared with population controls. In the After Diabetes Diagnosis Research Support System-2 (ADDRESS-2) cohort (n = 1458) clinician-diagnosed type 1 diabetes was confirmed by positivity for one or more islet-specific autoantibodies. In UK Biobank (n = 2502), we estimated type 1 diabetes incidence rates relative to baseline HLA risk for each HLA group using Poisson regression. Analyses were restricted to white Europeans and were performed in three groups according to age at type 1 diabetes onset: 0–18 years, 19–30 years and 31–50 years. Results: DR15-DQ6 was protective against type 1 diabetes through to age 50 years (OR < 1 for each age group, all p < 0.001). The following ORs for type 1 diabetes, relative to a neutral HLA genotype, were observed in ADDRESS-2: age 5–18 years OR 0.16 (95% CI 0.08, 0.31); age 19–30 years OR 0.10 (0.04, 0.23); and age 31–50 years OR 0.37 (0.21, 0.68). DR15-DQ6 also remained highly protective at all ages in UK Biobank. Without DR15-DQ6, the presence of major type 1 diabetes high-risk haplotype (either DR3-DQ2 or DR4-DQ8) was associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes. Conclusions/interpretation: HLA DR15-DQ6 confers dominant protection from type 1 diabetes across the first five decades of life.

The aim was to investigate whether SES is related to haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) during the first year after diagnosis in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and if metabolic, quality of care or mental factors may explain the association. Methods: In the German Diabetes Study, people with type 1 (n = 274, median age 36 [25th; 75th percentile: 28; 48] years) and type 2 diabetes (n = 424, 54 [47; 60] years) underwent detailed metabolic characterisation within the first year after diagnosis. SES was documented using a standardised questionnaire. Associations between SES and HbA1c were assessed using multivariable linear regression and restricted cubic spline regression analyses. Additional covariables were patient characteristics, laboratory measurements, health behaviour, quality of care and depression variables. Models were separately fitted for diabetes type, SES and its dimensions (income, education, occupation). Results: Higher SES score was associated with lower HbA1c (−0.7 mmol/mol per unit increase in SES, 95% CI: −1.1; −0.2 mmol/mol [−0.1%, 95% CI: −0.1; 0.0%]) in people with type 1 diabetes. Included covariates did not attenuate this association. In people with type 2 diabetes, effect estimates were close to zero indicating no relevant difference. Conclusion: Socio-economic inequalities in HbA1c already exist during the first year after diagnosis in people with type 1 diabetes. The absence of association between glycaemic control and SES in type 2 diabetes could be due to the lower complexity of diabetes therapy compared to type 1 diabetes. © 2022 The Authors.

Methods: In 422 European-ancestry participants, we assessed associations using additive models between 15 candidate SNPs and 25-year mortality, cardiovascular disease, microalbuminuria, overt nephropathy and proliferative retinopathy, and 25-year mean HbA1c, estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR, inverse measure of insulin resistance), and BMI. Results: The A allele of rs12970134 was associated with higher mean HbA1c (β = +0.34 ± 0.09, p = 0.00009) and nominally associated with worse eGDR (p = 0.02). Further analyses suggest the HbA1c association may be modified by diabetes therapy regimen: rs12970134 AA genotype was associated with higher HbA1c under non-intensive therapy conditions (<3 insulin injections/day or monitoring blood glucose<3 times/day [p = 0.004]), but not under intensive therapy (≥3 injections/day or insulin pump and monitoring glucose≥3 times/day [p = 0.71]). There were no significant associations between any SNPs and BMI or complications. Conclusions: rs12970134, near MC4R, is strongly associated with HbA1c in this cohort. Further exploration of this genomic region is warranted, as it may hold promise for discovering new therapeutic targets to improve glycemic control in T1D. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","R.G.

Participants were divided into two groups (deficiency group—DG, n = 10; suboptimal group—SG, n = 10) according to their vitamin D levels. All patients performed aerobic and mixed (aerobic-anaerobic) physical efforts. During the exercise, the respiratory responses and glucose levels were monitored. Biochemical blood analyses were performed before each physical effort. The oxygen consumption was not significantly lower in SG during both aerobic and mixed effort (4.0% and 5.6%, respectively). The glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level was higher by 6.1% and the total daily dose of insulin (DDI) was higher by 18.4% in the DG. The differences were not statistically significant. Patients with lower vitamin D levels demonstrated an insignificantly higher glycaemic variability during days with both aerobic and mixed exercises. An appropriate vitamin D concentration in T1DM patients’ blood may constitute a prophylactic factor for hyperglycaemia during anaerobic training and hypoglycaemia during aerobic training. © 2020 by the authors.

Sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy has been widely used in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus, but its use in patients with NDM is limited. We report three patients with NDM who received SAP therapy using the MiniMed™ 640G system starting in the neonatal period. Two patients were treated for 3 months, and one patient continued treatment up to an age of 22 mo. The MiniMed 640G system can automatically suspend insulin delivery (SmartGuard™ Technology) to avoid hypoglycemia when the sensor glucose level is predicted to approach the predefined threshold. We suggest that SmartGuard Technology is particularly useful for infants in whom hypoglycemia cannot be identified. The MiniMed 640G system automatically records the trends of sensor glucose levels and the total daily dose of insulin, which can make the management more accurate and reduce the family’s effort. SAP therapy for patients with NDM automatically prevents severe hypoglycemia and is useful for long-term management; however, attention should be paid to its application. © 2022 by The Japanese Society for Pediatric Endocrinology.","Y.

Islet amyloid formation contributes to β-cell dysfunction and death in the disease and to the failure of islet transplants. Recent work suggests a role for IAPP aggregation in cardiovascular complications of type-2 diabetes and hints at a possible role in type-1 diabetes. The mechanisms of IAPP amyloid formation in vivo or in vitro are not understood and the mechanisms of IAPP induced β-cell death are not fully defined. Activation of the inflammasome, defects in autophagy, ER stress, generation of reactive oxygen species, membrane disruption, and receptor mediated mechanisms have all been proposed to play a role. Open questions in the field include the relative importance of the various mechanisms of β-cell death, the relevance of reductionist biophysical studies to the situation in vivo, the molecular mechanism of amyloid formation in vitro and in vivo, the factors which trigger amyloid formation in type-2 diabetes, the potential role of IAPP in type-1 diabetes, the development of clinically relevant inhibitors of islet amyloidosis toxicity, and the design of soluble, bioactive variants of IAPP for use as adjuncts to insulin therapy. © 2016 Rehana Akter et al.","D.P.

We herein describe the first case of rheumatoid arthritis that was associated with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 variant. CASE REPORT: A 77-year-old woman with a 15-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) presented with polyarthralgia and hyperglycaemia. Methotrexate 16 mg/week had been started from the onset and was continued, and adalimumab 40 mg/day was started for RA. Insulin treatment was also started for the diabetes. Laboratory examinations revealed high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and matrix metalloprotease 3. She was admitted multiple times as the symptoms recurred after treatment. Subsequently, based on the clinical course and investigations, she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and Graves' disease occurring during the course of RA and T2D. Her clinical course improved after reinforcement of insulin therapy and the addition of thiamazole therapy. CONCLUSION: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 variant should be considered as the cause of the deterioration.","","","NLM (Medline)","2501062X","","","31756165","English","Rom J Intern Med","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081944265"

This can be done in a simple and cheap way via determination of autoantibodies. Autoantibody analysis can be used to detect the 7–12% of people with diabetes that is phenotypic of type 2 diabetes but is, in fact, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), which may be regarded as a variant of type 1 diabetes. This may help to explain why some individuals with type 2 diabetes do not go into remission after reducing their weight, while others do, and why remission sometimes ends earlier than expected.

Patients with Down syndrome (DS) resulting from trisomy 21 are four times more likely to have childhood diabetes with an intermediate HLA association. It is not known whether DS can cause PNDM. We found that trisomy 21 was seven times more likely in our PNDM cohort than in the population (13 of 1,522 = 85 of 10,000 observed vs. 12.6 of 10,000 expected) and none of the 13 DS-PNDM patients had a mutation in the known PNDM genes that explained 82.9% of non-DS PNDM. Islet autoantibodies were present in 4 of 9 DS-PNDM patients, but DS-PNDM was not associated with polygenic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D). We conclude that trisomy 21 is a cause of autoimmune PNDM that is not HLA associated. We propose that autoimmune diabetes in DS is heterogeneous and includes coincidental T1D that is HLA associated and diabetes caused by trisomy 21 that is not HLA associated. © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","A.T.

However, less than half of those who fail to achieve insulin independence carry the allele. We investigated whether genetic polymorphism at the recipients’ zinc transporter 8-encoding SLC30A8 gene (rs13266634) could complement their HLA-A*24 status in predicting functional graft outcome. Methods: We retrospectively analysed data of a hospital-based patient cohort followed for 18 months post transplantation. Forty C-peptide-negative type 1 diabetic individuals who received >2 million beta cells (>4000 islet equivalents) per kg body weight in one or two intraportal implantations under similar immunosuppression were genotyped for SLC30A8. Outcome measurements included achievement and maintenance of graft function. Metabolic benefit was defined as <25% CV of fasting glycaemia in the presence of >331 pmol/l C-peptide, in addition to achievement of insulin independence and maintenance of C-peptide positivity. Results: In multivariate analysis, HLA-A*24 positivity, presence of SLC30A8 CT or TT genotypes and BMI more than or equal to the group median (23.9 kg/m2) were independently associated with failure to achieve insulin independence (p = 0.015–0.046). The risk increased with the number of factors present (p < 0.001). High BMI interacted with SLC30A8 T allele carriership to independently predict difficulty in achieving graft function with metabolic benefit (p = 0.015). Maintenance of C-peptide positivity was mainly associated with older age at the time of implantation. Only HLA-A*24 carriership independently predicted failure to maintain acceptable graft function once achieved (p = 0.012). Conclusions/interpretation: HLA-A*24, the SLC30A8 T allele and high BMI are associated with poor graft outcome and should be considered in the interpretation of future transplantation trials.

Patients and Methods: Two hundred and thirty-one Thai type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients out of 300 participants with recent-onset diabetes were analyzed for GAD65 and IA2 pancreatic autoantibodies. A total of 30 individuals with T1D patients with negative autoantibody were screened for 32 monogenic diabetes genes by whole-exome sequencing (WES). Results: All participants were ten men and twenty women. The median age to onset of diabetes was 8 years and 3 months. A total of 20 people with monogenic diabetes carried genes related to monogenic diabetes. The PAX4 (rs2233580) in ten patients with monogenic diabetes was found. Seven variants of WFS1 (Val412Ala, Glu737Lys, Gly576Ser, Cys673Tyr, Arg456His, Lys424Glu, and Gly736fs) were investigated in patients in this study. Furthermore, the pathogenic variant, rs115099192 (Pro407Gln) in the GATA4 gene was found. Most patients who carried PAX4 (c.575G>A, rs2233580) did not have a history of DKA. The pathogenic variant GATA4 variant (c.1220C>A, rs115099192) was found in a patient with a history of DKA. Conclusion: This study demonstrated significant genetic overlap between autoantibody-negative diabetes and monogenic diabetes using WES. All candidate variants were considered disease risk with clinically significant variants. WES screening was the first implemented to diagnose monogenic diabetes in Thai children, and fourteen novel variants were identified in this study and need to be investigated in the future. © 2024 Teerawattanapong et al.","W.

Immune dysregulation and alterations in the dipeptidyl-peptidase- 4-incretin system might have a role in disease development, but their connection is poorly understood. We assessed the associations of a few selected, immunologically relevant single nucleotide gene variants with the DPP-4-incretin system in individuals with T1DM and in healthy controls. Prandial plasma (total, active) GLP-1 levels, serum DPP-4 activity, CD25 and CTLA-4 expression of T cells and DPP4 rs6741949, CTLA4 rs3087243, CD25 rs61839660 and PTPN2 rs2476601 SNPs were assessed in 33 T1DM patients and 34 age-, gender-, BMI-matched non-diabetic controls without a family history of T1DM. CTLA-4 expression was lower in the Foxp3+CD25+ regulatory T cells from individuals homozygous for the CTLA4 rs3087243-G variant compared to those who carry an A allele. Prandial plasma total GLP-1 levels 45 min after a standardized meal were reduced in individuals homozygous for the CTLA4 rs3087243 G major allele compared to A allele carriers both in the entire study population (with statistical power over 90%) and within the T1DM group. Here we report for the first time a reduced total prandial GLP-1 plasma concentration in individuals with the CTLA4 rs3087243 G/G genotype. One may speculate that immune response-related L cell damage might possibly explain this novel association. © 2019 Termedia Publishing House Ltd.. All rights reserved.","G.

A total of 1,119 children with T1DM (aged 4-18 years) were qualified to take part in the study. All children were genotyped for variants of FTO, MC4R, INSIG2, FASN, NPC1, PTER, SIRT1, MAF, IRT1, and CD36. Results. Variants of FTO showed significant association with BMI-SDS in the T1DM group. The main factors influencing BMI-SDS in children with T1DM included female gender (P = 0.0003), poor metabolic control (P = 0.0001), and carriage of the A allele of the FTO rs9939609 gene (P = 0.02). Conclusion. Our research indicates, when assessing, the risk of overweight and obesity carriage of the A allele in the rs9939609 site of the FTO gene adds to that of female gender and poormetabolic control.

Identification and early intervention are important for latent autoimmune diabetes in youth (LADY). The aims of this study were to investigate 1) the frequencies of the epitope-specific GAD65Abs and HLA-DR-DQ genes in LADY and 2) the association between HLA-DR-DQ genes and epitope-specific GAD65Abs. Higher frequencies of GAD65-CAb and multiepitope GAD65Abs were observed in young type 1 diabetes, LADY, and old type 1 diabetes subjects than those in latent autoimmune diabetes in adult (LADA) patients. The frequencies of the specific susceptible HLA haplotype DR3, total susceptible HLA haplotypes, and high-risk genotypes were higher in type 1 diabetes and LADY patients than those in LADA patients. In contrast, type 1 diabetes and LADY patients had lower frequencies of low/no genetic risk genotypes (DRX/X) than those of LADA patients. Logistic regression analysis suggested that the susceptible HLA haplotypes were risk factors for glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) multiepitope positivity in autoimmune diabetes mellitus. LADY may be more severe than LADA, and LADY seemed to be a transitional type of type 1 diabetes and LADA. GADA epitope and HLA-DR-DQ gene assays are important for risk stratification in autoimmune diabetes mellitus and protection of islet function.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble sterol derivative that not only participates in calcium and phosphorus metabolism but also acts as an immunomodulatory role by binding to nuclear vitamin D receptors to regulate the expression of transcription factors. Increasing evidence has shown that vitamin D has immunoregulation and anti-inflammatory effects, and it may play a role in T cell regulatory responses due to downregulation in the expression of cathepsin G and inhibition of CD4+ T cell activation and protection of β cells from immune attack and is beneficial in decreasing oxidative stress in T1DM patients. Epidemiologic evidence demonstrates involvement of vitamin D deficiency in T1DM pathogenesis, with the immune system improperly targeting and destroying its own islet β cells. In addition, polymorphisms in genes critical for vitamin D metabolism may increase the risk of islet autoimmunity and T1DM. In this paper, the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and the molecular mechanism of T1DM was discussed.  © 2022 Lian-Ping He et al.","C.-W.

The prevalence of type 1 diabetes is high in Finnish children but systematic screening for monogenic diabetes has not been conducted. We assessed the prevalence and clinical manifestations of monogenic diabetes in children initially registered with type 1 diabetes in the Finnish Pediatric Diabetes Register (FPDR) but who had no type 1 diabetes-related autoantibodies (AABs) or had only low-titre islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs) at diagnosis. Methods: The FPDR, covering approximately 90% of newly diagnosed diabetic individuals aged ≤15 years in Finland starting from 2002, includes data on diabetes-associated HLA genotypes and AAB data (ICA, and autoantibodies against insulin, GAD, islet antigen 2 and zinc transporter 8) at diagnosis. A next generation sequencing gene panel including 42 genes was used to identify monogenic diabetes. We interpreted the variants in HNF1A by using the gene-specific standardised criteria and reported pathogenic and likely pathogenic findings only. For other genes, we also reported variants of unknown significance if an individual’s phenotype suggested monogenic diabetes. Results: Out of 6482 participants, we sequenced DNA for 152 (2.3%) testing negative for all AABs and 49 (0.8%) positive only for low-titre ICAs (ICAlow). A monogenic form of diabetes was revealed in 19 (12.5%) of the AAB-negative patients (14 [9.2%] had pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants) and two (4.1%) of the ICAlow group. None had ketoacidosis at diagnosis or carried HLA genotypes conferring high risk for type 1 diabetes. The affected genes were GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, INS, KCNJ11, RFX6, LMNA and WFS1. A switch from insulin to oral medication was successful in four of five patients with variants in HNF1A, HNF4A or KCNJ11. Conclusions/interpretation: More than 10% of AAB-negative children with newly diagnosed diabetes had a genetic finding associated with monogenic diabetes. Because the genetic diagnosis can lead to major changes in treatment, we recommend referring all AAB-negative paediatric patients with diabetes for genetic testing. Low-titre ICAs in the absence of other AABs does not always indicate a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2022, The Author(s).","M.

With these unexpected findings for T1D, we sequenced the donor DNA and found a pathogenic heterozygous variant in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor- 1α (HNF1A). In one of the first studies of human pancreatic islets with a disease-causing HNF1A variant associated with the most common form of monogenic diabetes, we found that HNF1A dysfunction leads to insulin-insufficient diabetes reminiscent of T1D by impacting the regulatory processes critical for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and suggest a rationale for a therapeutic alternative to current treatment. © 2019 American Society for Clinical Investigation.

Genetic susceptibility to young-onset type 1 diabetes is well defined and does not predispose to type 2 diabetes. It is not known how frequently genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes leads to a diagnosis of diabetes after age 30 years. We aimed to investigate the frequency and phenotype of type 1 diabetes resulting from high genetic susceptibility in the first six decades of life. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis, we used a type 1 diabetes genetic risk score based on 29 common variants to identify individuals of white European descent in UK Biobank in the half of the population with high or low genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to evaluate the number of cases of diabetes in both groups in the first six decades of life. We genetically defined type 1 diabetes as the additional cases of diabetes that occurred in the high genetic susceptibility group compared with the low genetic susceptibility group. All remaining cases were defined as type 2 diabetes. We assessed the clinical characteristics of the groups with genetically defined type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Findings: 13 250 (3·5%) of 379 511 white European individuals in UK Biobank had developed diabetes in the first six decades of life. 1286 more cases of diabetes were in the half of the population with high genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes than in the half of the population with low genetic susceptibility. These genetically defined cases of type 1 diabetes were distributed across all ages of diagnosis; 537 (42%) were in individuals diagnosed when aged 31–60 years, representing 4% (537/12 233) of all diabetes cases diagnosed after age 30 years. The clinical characteristics of the group diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when aged 31–60 years were similar to the clinical characteristics of the group diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when aged 30 years or younger. For individuals diagnosed with diabetes when aged 31–60 years, the clinical characteristics of type 1 diabetes differed from those of type 2 diabetes: they had a lower BMI (27·4 kg/m2 [95% CI 26·7–28·0] vs 32·4 kg/m2 [32·2–32·5]; p<0·0001), were more likely to use insulin in the first year after diagnosis (89% [476/537] vs 6% [648/11 696]; p<0·0001), and were more likely to have diabetic ketoacidosis (11% [61/537] vs 0·3% [30/11 696]; p<0·0001). Interpretation: Genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes results in non-obesity-related, insulin-dependent diabetes, which presents throughout the first six decades of life. Our results highlight the difficulty of identifying type 1 diabetes after age 30 years because of the increasing background prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Failure to diagnose late-onset type 1 diabetes can have serious consequences because these patients rapidly develop insulin dependency. Funding: Wellcome Trust and Diabetes UK. © 2018 The Author(s).

This occurrence can either develop on a background of type 1 diabetes due to an abnormal increase in weight from physiological growth spurt in adolescents or from high insulin dosage developing on a background of type 2 diabetes. The variant has been linked to possible increased cardiovascular risks and worsened morbidity including poor glycaemic control. Here, we report a case of a 17-year-old girl who developed features of type 2 diabetes on a background of type 1 diagnosed 6 years after T1D diagnosis. © Michael Adeyemi Olamoyegun et al.","M.A. Olamoyegun; Department of Medicine, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism Unit, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso, Nigeria; email: maolamoyegun@lautech.edu","","African Field Epidemiology Network","19378688","","","33209162","English","Pan Afr.

Objective: We aimed to study the epidemiology, describe the clinical characteristics, and report results of genetic studies in pediatric patients with idiopathic type 1 diabetes. Methods: This was a prospective study of type 1 diabetes patients attending Sidra Medicine from 2018 to 2020. Autoantibodies (GAD65, IAA, IA-2A, and ZnT8) were measured and genetic testing was undertaken in patients negative for autoantibodies to rule out monogenic diabetes. Demographic and clinical data of patients with idiopathic type 1 diabetes were compared with patients with autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Results: Of 1157 patients with type 1 diabetes, 63 were antibody-negative. Upon genome sequencing, 4 had maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), 2 had Wolfram syndrome, 1 had H syndrome, and 3 had variants of uncertain significance in MODY genes; 53 patients had idiopathic type 1 diabetes. The most common age of diagnosis was 10 to 14 years. C-peptide level was low but detectable in 30 patients (56.6%) and normal in 23 patients (43.4%) The average body mass index was in the normal range and 33% of the patients had a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Conclusion: Four percent of the children had idiopathic type 1 diabetes. There were statistically significant differences in the C-peptide level and insulin requirement between the 2 groups. DKA was less common in the idiopathic group. Mutations in MODY genes suggest the importance of autoantibody testing and genetic screening for known causes of monogenic diabetes in idiopathic type 1 diabetes. The mechanism of idiopathic type 1 diabetes is unknown but could be due to defects in antibody production or due to autoantibodies that are not yet detectable or discovered. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Material and methods: A group of 108 children with type 1 diabetes were genotyped in HLA-A, -DRB1, and -DQB1 genes using hybridization with oligonucleotides probes. Plasma C-peptide concentration was assessed by radioimmunoassay method. Results: No differences in allele HLA-A distribution between type 1 diabetes patients and healthy individuals were found. Among “low C-peptide”(< 0.28 pmol/ml) individuals, the frequency of HLA-A∗02 allele was 41.3%, whereas only one HLA-A∗26 allele was detected in this group (0.7%). Conversely, among “high C-peptide”(≥ 0.28 pmol/ml) probands the prevalence of A∗02 allele was 19.7% (Pc = 0.008, OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2–1.7) and A∗26 10.5 % (Pc < 0.007, OR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.02–0.9). Genotype analysis showed that A∗02/∗02 and A∗02/X children were more likely to have “low” C-peptide at the onset compared to those with non-A∗02/non-A∗02 genotype (p = 0.008, OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.3–2.0 and p = 0.015, OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1–1.9, respectively). A02 phenotype individuals had lower median C-peptide (0.17 pmol/ml) than non-A02 patients (0.26 pmol/ml, p = 0.008). Median C-peptide was higher in the A26-positive group comparing to A26-negative (0.40 and 0.20, respectively, p = 0.04). No association between HLA class II and C-peptide levels was observed. Conclusions: HLA-A alleles are not associated with disease development nevertheless strongly influence a residual pancreatic b-cell function. The results suggest a different role of HLA class I and class II in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. © Copyright by PTEiDD 2020.","A.

The current standard-of-care for T1D is exogenous insulin replacement therapy. Recent developments in this field include the hybrid closed-loop system for regulated insulin delivery and long-acting insulins. Clinical studies on prediction and prevention of diabetes-associated complications have demonstrated the importance of early treatment and glucose control for reducing the risk of developing diabetic complications. Transplantation of primary islets offers an effective approach for treating patients with T1D. However, this strategy is hampered by challenges such as the limited availability of islets, extensive death of islet cells, and poor vascular engraftment of islets post-transplantation. Accordingly, there are considerable efforts currently underway for enhancing islet transplantation efficiency by harnessing the beneficial actions of stem cells. This review will provide an overview of currently available therapeutic options for T1D, and discuss the growing evidence that supports the use of stem cell approaches to enhance therapeutic outcomes. © The Author(s) 2019.","V.

We conducted a two-sample mendelian randomization study from the perspective of genetics to assess these associations. Methods: 20 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with diabetic retinopathy were selected from the FinnGen consortium. Summary-level data for diabetic nephropathy were obtained from the publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) database, FinnGen and CKDGen consortium. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) was selected as the primary analysis. MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), simple mode and weighted mode were used as complementary methods to examine causality. Additionally, sensitivity analyses including Cochran’s Q test, MR-Egger, MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), and leave-one-out analyses were conducted to guarantee the accuracy and robustness of our MR analysis. Results: Our current study demonstrated positive associations of genetically predicted diabetic retinopathy with diabetic nephropathy (OR=1.32; P=3.72E-11), type 1 diabetes with renal complications (OR=1.96; P= 7.11E-11), and type 2 diabetes with renal complications (OR=1.26, P=3.58E-04). Further subtype analysis and multivariate mendelian randomization (MVMR) also reached the same conclusion. A significant casualty with DN was demonstrated both in non-proliferative DR (OR=1.07, P=0.000396) and proliferative DR (OR=1.67, P=3.699068E-14). All the findings were robust across several sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: Consistent with previous clinical studies, our findings revealed a positive correlation between DR and DN, providing genetic evidence for the non-invasive nature of DR in predicting DN.

Loss of beta-cells leads to insulin insufficiency and hyperglycemia, with patients eventually requiring lifelong insulin therapy to maintain normal glycemic control. Since T1D has been historically defined as a disease of immune system dysregulation, there has been little focus on the state and response of beta-cells and how they may also contribute to their own demise. Major hurdles to identifying a cure for T1D include a limited understanding of disease etiology and how functional and transcriptional beta-cell heterogeneity may be involved in disease progression. Recent studies indicate that the beta-cell response is not simply a passive aspect of T1D pathogenesis, but rather an interplay between the beta-cell and the immune system actively contributing to disease. Here, we comprehensively review the current literature describing beta-cell vulnerability, heterogeneity, and contributions to pathophysiology of T1D, how these responses are influenced by autoimmunity, and describe pathways that can potentially be exploited to delay T1D. © Copyright © 2021 Toren, Burnette, Banerjee, Hunter and Tse.","; ; ","","Frontiers Media S.A.","16643224","","","34691077","English","Front.

In this issue of the JCI, Yu et al. evaluated HLA variants, autoantibody status, β cell function, C-peptide release, and monogenetic diabetes genes in a cohort of Medalists.

Several large clinical trials and smaller mechanistic studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of insulin antigen therapy. The growing awareness of the heterogeneity of T1D likely affects the response to various immune therapies including insulin. Identification of biomarkers of clinical response will provide further insight into mechanisms leading to the disease and classify responders in the quest for personalized therapy.Recent findingsSeveral biomarkers have identified subpopulations in posthoc analyses that showed benefit from oral insulin even though the placebo-controlled study was as a whole unsuccessful. High insulin autoantibody titer, low first phase insulin response, and high Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 Risk Score identify at-risk relatives more likely to benefit from oral insulin. Future incorporation of human leukocyte antigen and the variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism located in the insulin gene promoter (INS VNTR) is of interest for both primary and secondary prevention studies.SummaryAlthough primary and secondary prevention trials using oral insulin are ongoing, those completed have been largely unsuccessful. However, we believe that oral insulin should be considered in future trials as part of combination therapies as prerandomization biomarker testing is refined. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Diabetes is a group of highly heterogeneous metabolic diseases that can be classified as type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), or other according to the etiology. The clinical manifestations are more or less similar among the different types of diabetes, and each type is highly heterogeneous due to different pathogenic factors. Therefore, distinguishing between various types of diabetes and defining their subtypes are major challenges hindering the precise treatment of the disease. T2D is the main type of diabetes in humans as well as the most heterogeneous. Fortunately, some studies have shown that variants of certain genes involved in monogenic diabetes also increase the risk of T2D. We hope this finding will enable breakthroughs regarding the pathogenesis of T2D and facilitate personalized treatment of the disease by exploring the function of the signal genes involved. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox A (HNF1α) is widely expressed in pancreatic β cells, the liver, the intestines, and other organs. HNF1α is highly polymorphic, but lacks a mutation hot spot. Mutations can be found at any site of the gene. Some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) while some others do not cause MODY3 but increase the susceptibility to T2D or GDM. The phenotypes of MODY3 caused by different SNPs also differ. MODY3 is among the most common types of MODY, which is a form of monogenic diabetes mellitus caused by a single gene mutation. Both T2D and GDM are multifactorial diseases caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Different types of diabetes mellitus have different clinical phenotypes and treatments. This review focuses on HNF1α gene polymorphisms, HNF1A-MODY3, HNF1A-associated T2D and GDM, and the related pathogenesis and treatment methods. We hope this review will provide a valuable reference for the precise and individualized treatment of diabetes caused by abnormal HNF1α by summarizing the clinical heterogeneity of blood glucose abnormalities caused by HNF1α mutation.

Characterising factors explaining differences in an individual’s clinical course and treatment response will have important clinical and research implications. Our aim was to explore type 1 diabetes heterogeneity, as assessed by clinical characteristics, autoantibodies, beta cell function and glycaemic outcomes, during the first 12 months from diagnosis, and how it relates to age at diagnosis. Methods: Data were collected from the large INNODIA cohort of individuals (aged 1.0–45.0 years) newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, followed 3 monthly, to assess clinical characteristics, C-peptide, HbA1c and diabetes-associated antibodies, and their changes, during the first 12 months from diagnosis, across three age groups: <10 years; 10–17 years; and ≥18 years. Results: The study population included 649 individuals (57.3% male; age 12.1±8.3 years), 96.9% of whom were positive for one or more diabetes-related antibodies. Baseline (IQR) fasting C-peptide was 242.0 (139.0–382.0) pmol/l (AUC 749.3 [466.2–1106.1] pmol/l × min), with levels increasing with age (p<0.001). Over time, C-peptide remained lower in participants aged <10 years but it declined in all age groups. In parallel, glucose levels progressively increased. Lower baseline fasting C-peptide, BMI SD score and presence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis were associated with lower stimulated C-peptide over time. HbA1c decreased during the first 3 months (p<0.001), whereas insulin requirement increased from 3 months post diagnosis (p<0.001). Conclusions/interpretation: In this large cohort with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, we identified age-related differences in clinical and biochemical variables. Of note, C-peptide was lower in younger children but there were no main age differences in its rate of decline. Graphical Abstract: (Figure presented.). © The Author(s) 2024.","M.L.

We examined the associations of FPIR with genetic variants outside the HLA DR-DQ region in the Finnish Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) study in children with and without multiple autoantibodies. Association between FPIR and class I alleles A*24 and B*39 and eight single nucleotide polymorphisms outside the HLA region were analyzed in 438 children who had one or more FPIR results available after seroconversion. Hierarchical linear mixed models were used to analyze repeated measurements of FPIR. In children with multiple autoantibodies, the change in FPIR over time was significantly different between those with various PTPN2 (rs45450798), FUT2 (rs601338), CTSH (rs3825932), and IKZF4 (rs1701704) genotypes in at least one of the models. In general, children carrying susceptibility alleles for type 1 diabetes experienced a more rapid decline in insulin secretion compared with children without susceptibility alleles. The presence of the class I HLA A∗24 allele was also associated with a steeper decline of FPIR over time in children with multiple autoantibodies.

Although plant sterols, once absorbed, can promote atherosclerosis, their intake is believed to be safe because of poor absorption, except in rare hyperabsorbers with homozygous ABCG5/8 mutations. We report a case of new-onset type 1 diabetes accompanied by hypercholesterolemia. At the initial presentation with diabetic ketoacidosis, the patient showed marked hypercholesterolemia. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ABCG5 (p.R419H). The initial serum plant sterol levels were markedly high (sitosterol 32.5 μg/mL, campesterol 66.0 μg/mL), close to the range observed in patients with homozygous ABCG5/8 mutations, which were largely reduced by insulin treatment without ezetimibe. The addition of ezetimibe normalized plant sterol levels. These findings provide the first evidence that uncontrolled diabetes plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of phytosterolemia. © 2022 The Authors.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus induced by them (ICI-T1DM) is a serious complication requiring prompt insulin treatment, but the immunological mechanism behind it is unclear. Methods: We examined amino acid polymorphisms in human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules and investigated proinsulin epitope binding affinities to HLA molecules. Results and Discussion: Twelve patients with ICI-T1DM and 35 patients in a control group without ICI-T1DM were enrolled in the study. Allele and haplotype frequencies of HLA-DRB1*04:05, DQB1*04:01, and most importantly DPB1*05:01 were significantly increased in patients with ICI-T1DM. In addition, novel amino acid polymorphisms in HLA-DR (4 polymorphisms), in DQ (12 polymorphisms), and in DP molecules (9 polymorphisms) were identified. These amino acid polymorphisms might be associated with the development of ICI-T1DM. Moreover, novel human proinsulin epitope clusters in insulin A and B chains were discovered in silico and in vitro peptide binding assays to HLA-DP5. In conclusion, significant amino acid polymorphisms in HLA-class II molecules, and conformational alterations in the peptide-binding groove of the HLA-DP molecules were considered likely to influence the immunogenicity of proinsulin epitopes in ICI-T1DM. These amino acid polymorphisms and HLA-DP5 may be predictive genetic factors for ICI-T1DM.

However, it is still unclear how vascular function changes with the development of diabetes and what differences exist between cerebral and cutaneous vascular dysfunction. Thus, it is very important to monitor changes in cerebral and cutaneous vascular function responses in vivo and study their differences during diabetes development. Methods: With the assistance of newly developed skull and skin optical clearing techniques, we monitored the responses of sodium nitroprusside (SNP)- and acetyl choline (ACh)-induced cerebral and cutaneous vascular blood flow and blood oxygen in diabetic mice in vivo during the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) by combining laser speckle contrast imaging with hyperspectral imaging. We then compared the differences between cerebral and cutaneous vascular responses and explored the reasons for abnormal changes induced in response to different vascular beds. Results: In the early stage of diabetes (T1D-1 week), there were abnormal changes in the cerebral vascular blood flow and blood oxygen responses to SNP and ACh as well as cutaneous vascular blood oxygen. The cutaneous vascular blood flow response also became abnormal from T1D-3 weeks. Additionally, the T1D-induced abnormal blood flow response was associated with changes in vascular myosin light chain phosphorylation and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 levels, and the aberrant blood oxygen response was related to an increase in glycated hemoglobin levels. Conclusion: These results suggest that the abnormal cutaneous vascular blood oxygen response occurred earlier than the blood flow response and therefore has the potential to serve as a good assessment indicator for revealing cerebrovascular dysfunction in the early stage of diabetes. © The author(s).","D.

According to the etiological classification, LADA should belong to the autoimmune subtype of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Previous studies have found general immune genetic effects associated with LADA, but there are also some racial differences. Multicenter studies have been conducted in different countries worldwide, but it is still unclear how the Chinese and Caucasian populations differ. The epidemiology and phenotypic characteristics of LADA may vary between Caucasian and Chinese diabetic patients as lifestyle, food habits, and body mass index differ between these two populations. The prevalence of LADA in China has reached a high level compared to other countries. The prevalence of LADA in China has reached a high level compared to other countries, and the number of patients with LADA ranks first in the world. Previous studies have found general immune genetic effects associated with LADA, but some racial differences also exist. The prevalence of LADA among newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients over the age of 30 years in China is 5.9%, and LADA patients account for 65% of the newly diagnosed T1D patients in the country. As a country with a large population, China has many people with LADA. A summary and analysis of these studies will enhance further understanding of LADA in China. In addition, comparing the similarities and differences between the Chinese and the Caucasian population from the perspectives of epidemiology, clinical, immunology and genetics will help to improve the understanding of LADA, and then promote LADA studies in individual populations.

The very low incidence of type 1 diabetes in the Japanese population, however, makes identification of such families difficult. We identified a Japanese family in which three members developed type 1 diabetes, and studied the genotype of the human leukocyte antigen. All three members with type 1 diabetes had the DRB1*08:02-DQB1*03:02 haplotype, which is specific to the Asian population and strongly susceptible for type 1 diabetes. In particular, a proband and his sister had the same genotype, DRB1*08:02-DQB1*03:02/DRB1*08:02-DQB1*03:02, which is extremely rare even in the Japanese population. Both parents also had DRB1*08:02-DQB1*03:02, but in combination with different human leukocyte antigen haplotypes. Weakly susceptible DRB1*13:02-DQB1*06:04 was present in the affected mother, and resistant DRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:02 in the unaffected father. These data suggest DRB1*08:02-DQB1*03:02 to be a contributing factor for familial clustering of type 1 diabetes in this family. © 2017 The Authors.

Research Design and Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed T1D (n=301) were included. GA/insulin dose was used to diagnose PR, and insulin dose-adjusted glycated albumin (IDAGA) was proposed to facilitate clinical application. The optimal diagnostic levels of IDAGA and stimulated C-peptide were determined in different age-groups (≤ 12y, 12-18y and ≥ 18y). Furthermore, the diagnostic consistency between different PR definitions was studied. Results: GA≤ 23%/insulin dose ≤ 0.5u/kg/day was used to define PR, and IDAGA (GA (%) + 40 * insulin dose(u/kg/day)) ≤ 40 was feasible in all age-groups. Whereas, the optimal diagnostic level showed difference for stimulated C-peptide (265.5, 449.3 and 241.1 pmol/L for the ≤ 12y, 12-18y and ≥ 18y age-group, respectively). About 40% of patients met the PR definition by stimulated C-peptide but not GA/insulin dose or IDAGA, who showed dyslipidemia and higher insulin resistance. Conclusions: A new definition of the PR phase is proposed using GA/insulin dose, and the calculated IDAGA≤ 40 applies to all age-groups. The stimulated C-peptide to diagnose PR is the highest in the 12-18y age-group, which reflects the effect of puberty on metabolism. For patients with insulin resistance, it is not recommended to use stimulated C-peptide alone to diagnose PR. Copyright © 2022 Shi, Ji, Xie, Zhong, Tang, Fan and Li.","X.

NDM is a rare disease in which gene variants mainly cause β-cell loss or dysfunction (6q24 duplication, KCNJ11, and ABCC8). Although NDM is primarily treated through insulin therapy, it is highly challenging to manage blood glucose levels using insulin therapy during infancy. In contrast, KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutant patients received oral sulfonylureas (SU) instead of insulin injections; however, the dose and frequency differ among individuals. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is useful in patients with type 1 diabetes; but reports on patients with NDM are lacking. Herein, we report two cases of NDM with the KCNJ11 variant. We used CGM not only during insulin injection therapy but also after switching to oral SU therapy. The CGM data can also be used to determine the dose and frequency of SU. Furthermore, long-term CGM may be useful for adjusting SU dose and frequency, and maintaining good glycemic control not only during insulin injection but also during oral SU therapy. © 2024 by The Japanese Society for Pediatric Endocrinology.","K.

We tested whether this protective INS variant associated with lowered risk for development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) as long-term diabetic complications. Insulin gene polymorphisms were evaluated in 1,363 type 1 diabetes patients participating in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study that compared intensive versus conventional insulin therapy in relation with development of PDR and DKD with a follow-up of over two decades. PDR and DKD were absent in type 1 diabetes patients carrying the protective INS variant and receiving intensive insulin therapy (the current standard of clinical care) 1-5 years from their diagnosis (n = 67; mean post-diagnosis follow up of 20.4 ± 1.6 years), versus 11 of 258 patients (4.3%) lacking this variant (20.4 ± 1.8 years follow up). In the secondary intervention group of the intensive therapy arm (1-15 years of disease), PDR was significantly less frequent in carriers of the protective INS variant than those without it (4 of 83 [4.8%] vs. 31 of 260 [11.9%]; p = 0.032; 26.1 ± 3.9 and 26.3 ± 4.1 years follow-up, respectively), whereas DKD frequencies were no different between those with or without this variant (5 of 83 [6.0%] vs. 11 of 260 [4.2%]). Carrying a copy of this protective INS variant further reduces the risk of diabetic complications achieved by intensive insulin therapy and marks a disease endotype with superior glycemic control, increased and extended beta cell function, and prevention of DKD and PDR. © 2023 van Tienhoven et al.

Type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are the most common forms with both types having invariable genetic influence. It is accepted that a subset of all diabetes patients, generally estimated to account for 1–2% of all diabetic cases, is attributed to mutations in single genes. As only a subset of these genes has been identified and fully characterized, there is a dramatic need to understand the pathophysiological impact of genetic determinants on β-cell function and pancreatic development but also on cell replacement therapies. Pluripotent stem cells differentiated along the pancreatic lineage provide a valuable research platform to study such genes.

We conducted a nationwide cohort and Mendelian randomisation analysis to investigate this link. Methods: This nationwide matched cohort used data from the Swedish ESPRESSO cohort including 46,150 individuals with coeliac disease and 219,763 matched individuals in the comparator group selected from the general population, followed up from 1969 to 2021. Data from 9053 individuals with coeliac disease who underwent a second biopsy were used to examine the association between persistent villous atrophy and type 2 diabetes. Multivariable Cox regression was employed to estimate the associations. In Mendelian randomisation analysis, 37 independent genetic variants associated with clinically diagnosed coeliac disease at p<5×10−8 were used to proxy genetic liability to coeliac disease. Summary-level data for type 2 diabetes were obtained from the DIAGRAM consortium (80,154 cases) and the FinnGen study (42,593 cases). Results: Over a median 15.7 years’ follow-up, there were 6132 (13.3%) and 30,138 (13.7%) incident cases of type 2 diabetes in people with coeliac disease and comparator individuals, respectively. Those with coeliac disease were not at increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes with an HR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.97, 1.03) compared with comparator individuals. Persistent villous atrophy was not associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with mucosal healing among participants with coeliac disease (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90, 1.16). Genetic liability to coeliac disease was not associated with type 2 diabetes in DIAGRAM (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99, 1.03) or in FinnGen (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99–1.04).

The purpose of this perspective is to present the case for primary prevention of beta-cell autoimmunity and to provide a study design for its implementation in Europe. Methods: We examined and summarized recruitment strategies, enrollment rates, and outcomes in published TRIGR, FINDIA and BABYDIET primary prevention trials, and the TEDDY intensive observational study. A proposal for a recruitment and implementation strategy to perform a phase II/III primary prevention randomized controlled trial in infants with genetic risk for developing beta-cell autoimmunity is outlined. Results: Infants with a family history of type 1 diabetes (TRIGR, BABYDIET, TEDDY) and infants younger than age 3 months from the general population (FINDIA, TEDDY) were enrolled into these studies. All studies used HLA genotyping as part of their eligibility criteria. Predicted beta-cell autoimmunity risk in the eligible infants ranged from 3% (FINDIA, TEDDY general population) up to 12% (TRIGR, BABYDIET). Amongst eligible infants, participation was between 38% (TEDDY general population) and 97% (FINDIA). Outcomes, defined as multiple beta-cell autoantibodies, were consistent with predicted risks. We subsequently modeled recruitment into a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that could assess the efficacy of oral insulin treatment as adapted from the Pre-POINT pilot trial. The RCT would recruit infants with and without a first-degree family history of type 1 diabetes and be based on general population genetic risk testing. HLA genotyping and, for the general population, genotyping at additional type 1 diabetes susceptibility SNPs would be used to identify children with around 10% risk of beta-cell autoimmunity. The proposed RCT would have 80% power to detect a 50% reduction in multiple beta-cell autoantibodies by age 4 years at a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, and would randomize around 1160 infants to oral insulin or placebo arms in order to fulfill this. It is estimated that recruitment would require testing of between 400,000 and 500,000 newborns or infants. Conclusion: It is timely and feasible to establish a platform for primary prevention trials for type 1 diabetes in Europe. This multi-site European infrastructure would perform RCTs, supply data coordination and biorepository, provide cohorts for mechanistic and observational studies, and increase awareness for autoimmune diabetes. © 2016 The Authors.","A.G.

As such, the beta cell has developed unique metabolic characteristics to achieve functionality; in healthy beta cells, the majority of glucose-derived carbons are oxidized and enter the mitochondria in the form of pyruvate. The pyruvate is subsequently metabolized to induce mitochondrial ATP and trigger the downstream insulin secretion response. Thus, in beta cells, mitochondria play a pivotal role in regulating glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). In type 2 diabetes (T2D), mitochondrial impairment has been shown to play an important role in beta cell dysfunction and loss. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoimmunity is the primary trigger of beta cell loss; however, there is accumulating evidence that intrinsic mitochondrial defects could contribute to beta cell susceptibility during proinflammatory conditions. Furthermore, there is speculation that dysfunctional mitochondrial responses could contribute to the formation of autoantigens. In this review, we provide an overview of mitochondrial function in the beta cells, and discuss potential mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to T1D pathogenesis. © 2021 by the authors.

Correctly identifying MODY is of considerable importance as diagnosing the specific genetic subtype can inform the optimal treatment, with many patients being able to discontinue unnecessary insulin treatment. Diagnostic molecular genetic testing to confirm MODY is expensive, so screening strategies are required to identify the most appropriate patients for testing. In this issue of Diabetologia, Johansson and colleagues (DOI 10.1007/s00125-016-4167-1) describe a nationwide systematic screening approach to identify individuals with MODY in the paediatric age range. They focused testing on patients negative for both GAD and islet antigen 2 (IA-2) islet autoantibodies, thereby ruling out those with markers of type 1 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes in this age group.

We examined the impact of two SNPs in the human insulin gene (INS), rs3842752 and rs689, and two in the insulin receptor gene (INSR) rs2245649 and rs2229429, on disease susceptibility, glycaemic control, and IAs formation in 100 T1D patients and 101 T2D patients treated with insulin. 79 individuals without diabetes were typed as healthy controls. The minor alleles of rs3842752 and rs689 in INS protected against T1D (OR: 0.50, p = 0.01 and OR: 0.44; p = 0.002, respectively). The minor alleles of both rs2245649 and rs2229429 in INSR were risk factors for poor glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 80 mmol/mol) in T1D (OR: 5.35, p = 0.009 and OR: 3.10, p = 0.01, respectively). Surprisingly, the minor alleles of rs2245649 and rs2229429 in INSR associated strongly with the absence of IAs in T1D (OR = 0.28, p = 0.008 and OR = 0.30, p = 0.002, respectively). In conclusion, the minor alleles of the investigated INS SNPs protect against T1D, and the minor alleles of the investigated INSR SNPs are associated with poor glycaemic control and the absence of IAs in T1D. © 2022 by the authors.

Methods: Clinical data obtained at diagnosis of stage 3 type 1 diabetes were evaluated in 128 children previously diagnosed with presymptomatic early-stage type 1 diabetes between 2015 and 2022 in the Fr1da study and compared with data from 736 children diagnosed with incident type 1 diabetes between 2009 and 2018 at a similar age in the DiMelli study without prior screening. Results: At the diagnosis of stage 3 type 1 diabetes, children with a prior early-stage diagnosis had lower median HbA1c (51 mmol/mol vs 91 mmol/mol [6.8% vs 10.5%], p<0.001), lower median fasting glucose (5.3 mmol/l vs 7.2 mmol/l, p<0.05) and higher median fasting C-peptide (0.21 nmol/l vs 0.10 nmol/l, p<0.001) compared with children without previous early-stage diagnosis. Fewer participants with prior early-stage diagnosis had ketonuria (22.2% vs 78.4%, p<0.001) or required insulin treatment (72.3% vs 98.1%, p<0.05) and only 2.5% presented with diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of stage 3 type 1 diabetes. Outcomes in children with a prior early-stage diagnosis were not associated with a family history of type 1 diabetes or diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. A milder clinical presentation was observed in children who participated in education and monitoring after early-stage diagnosis. Conclusions/interpretation: Diagnosis of presymptomatic type 1 diabetes in children followed by education and monitoring improved clinical presentation at the onset of stage 3 type 1 diabetes.

Combined effects of genetic and environmental factors cause T1DM, which make it difficult to predict whether an individual will inherit the disease. Due to the level of self-care necessary in T1DM maintenance, it is crucial for pediatric settings to support achieving optimal glucose control, especially when adolescents are beginning to take more responsibility for their own health. Innovative insulin delivery systems, such as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), and noninvasive glucose monitoring systems, such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), allow patients with T1DM to achieve a normal and flexible lifestyle. However, there are still challenges in achieving optimal glucose control despite advanced technology in T1DM administration. In this article, disease prediction and current management of T1DM are reviewed with special emphasis on biomarkers of pancreatic β-cell stress, CSII, glucose monitoring, and several other adjunctive therapies. © 2018 by The Korean Pediatric Society.","C.K.

Methods: A 17-year-old male had generalized dystonia that started at age 6 years, non-febrile abdominal pain attacks and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 14 years. Meanwhile, his 13-year-old sister had the same clinical presentation. His father was diabetic and his mother was asymptomatic. There was no consanguinity between the parents. Genetic variations were detected with whole exome sequencing. Results: VPS16 c.1513C>T/p.Arg505* (likely pathogenic), MEFV c.2080A>G p.Met694val (pathogenic) and MEFV c.1772T>C p.Ile591Thr (unknown significance) heterozygous variants were detected in his siblings. The father had VPS16 c.1513C>T/p.Arg505* and MEFV c.2080A>G p Met694val variations and the mother had MEFV c.1772T>C p.Ile591Thr variations. Conclusions: The occurrence of these diseases in siblings but their absence in the parents suggests the idea that the coexistence of two separate variations in the VPS16 and MEFV genes determines the phenotype. In addition, the increase in MEFV variation load in this family and the fact that DM occurs at an earlier age suggest that inflammation may cause an early diabetic clinical presentation. © The Author(s) 2024.","Y.I.

The objective of the present study was to assess the contribution of non-human leukocyte antigen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the risk of developing insulin-triggered type 1 diabetes. Materials and Methods: We genotyped 13 type 1 diabetes susceptible SNPs in six patients and compared them with those in Japanese controls (Hap Map3-JPT). The SNPs that showed statistically significant results were further analyzed using non-diabetic control participants and participants with type 2 diabetes at the Ehime University Hospital. Results: The risk allele frequency of BACH2 rs3757247 in the six patients was significantly more frequent than that in 86 Japanese controls (P = 0.038). No significant difference in the allele frequency was observed in the other SNPs. This result was confirmed by the findings that the risk allele frequency of BACH2 in the six patients was significantly higher than that in the non-diabetic control participants (n = 179) and type 2 diabetes with or without insulin treatment (n = 154 or n = 152; P = 0.035, 0.034 or 0.037, respectively). Despite being statistically not significant, the six patients were all homozygous for the CLEC16A rs12708716 risk allele and five were homozygous for the CLEC16A rs2903692 risk allele. Conclusions: In addition to type 1 diabetes high-risk human leukocyte antigen class II and the class I allele of the insulin gene variable number tandem repeat genotype, the possibility that the risk variants of BACH2 and CLEC16A could contribute to the development of insulin-triggered type 1 diabetes cannot be excluded. © 2019 The Authors.

The type 1 diabetes patient cohort is highly heterogeneous, with individuals presenting with disease at different stages and severities, arising from distinct etiologies, and overlaying varied genetic backgrounds. At present, the “one-size-fits-all” treatment for type 1 diabetes is exogenic insulin substitution therapy, but this approach fails to achieve optimal blood glucose control in many individuals. With advances in our understanding of early-stage diabetes development, diabetes stratification, and the role of genetics, type 1 diabetes is a promising candidate for a personalized medicine approach, which aims to apply “the right therapy at the right time, to the right patient”. In the case of type 1 diabetes, great efforts are now being focused on risk stratification for diabetes development to enable pre-clinical detection, and the application of treatments such as gene therapy, to prevent pancreatic destruction in a sub-set of patients. Alongside this, breakthroughs in stem cell therapies hold great promise for the regeneration of pancreatic tissues in some individuals. Here we review the recent initiatives in the field of personalized medicine for type 1 diabetes, including the latest discoveries in stem cell and gene therapy for the disease, and current obstacles that must be overcome before the dream of personalized medicine for all type 1 diabetes patients can be realized. © 2021, The Author(s).","A.A.-S.

Subjects with adult-onset autoimmune diabetes who do not necessitate insulin-therapy for at least 6 months after diagnosis are demarcated as having latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). This condition is more heterogeneous than young-onset autoimmune diabetes and shares clinical and metabolic characteristics with both type 2 and type 1 diabetes. Patients with LADA are considered by having highly variable β-cell destruction, different degrees of insulin resistance and heterogeneous titre and pattern of islet autoantibody, suggesting different pathophysiological pathways partially explaining the heterogeneous phenotypes of LADA. To date the heterogeneity of LADA does not allow to establish a priori treatment algorithm and no specific guidelines for LADA therapy are available. These subjects are mostly treated as affected by type 2 diabetes, a factor that might lead to the progression to insulin-dependency quickly. A personalised medicine approach is necessary to attain optimal metabolic control and preserve β-cell function to decrease the risk of long-term diabetes complications. Recent data concerning the use of oral antidiabetic agents as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists indicate up-and-coming results in term of protect C-peptide levels and improving glycaemic control. This review summarises current knowledge on LADA, emphasising controversies regarding its pathophysiology and clinical features. Moreover, we discuss data available about novel therapeutic approaches that can be considered for prevention of β-cell loss in LADA. © 2018 Korean Endocrine Society.","P.

The aim of the present study was to investigate if individuals with LADA have an altered gut microbiota relative to non-diabetic control subjects, individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D), and individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Bacterial community profiling was performed with primers targeting the variable region 4 of the 16S rRNA gene and sequenced. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were generated with DADA2 and annotated to the SILVA database. The gut virome was sequenced, using a viral particle enrichment and metagenomics approach, assembled, and quantified to describe the composition of the viral community. Comparison of the bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity measures revealed that the gut bacteriome of individuals with LADA resembled that of individuals with T2D. Yet, specific genera were found to differ in abundance in individuals with LADA compared with T1D and T2D, indicating that LADA has unique taxonomical features. The virome composition reflected the stability of the most dominant order Caudovirales and the families Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and Inoviridae, and the dominant family Microviridae. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. © The Author(s) 2024.","T.

We assessed plasma oxidant and antioxidant levels in response to acute and chronic hyperglycemia in relation to vascular stiffness and varying degrees of kidney disease in type 1 diabetes individuals. Methods: The acute hyperglycemia study included 22 type 1 diabetic individuals with normal albumin excretion rate (AER) and 13 non-diabetic controls. These individuals received an acute glucose challenge during a 120-minute hyperglycemic clamp. The chronic hyperglycemia study included 118 type 1 diabetic individuals with chronically low (n = 60) or high (n = 58) HbA1c concentrations and varying degrees of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) classified as normal, moderate, or severe albuminuria (AER). Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), biological antioxidant potential (BAP) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured from plasma or serum samples in the FinnDiane study. Results: Levels of MDA (p < 0.01) and ROMs (p < 0.01) were elevated in type 1 diabetes individuals compared to non-diabetic controls at baseline. Acute hyperglycemia further increased MDA levels (p < 0.05) and sustained the elevation of ROMs in type 1 diabetes individuals. Acute hyperglycemic challenge impaired TAC in both non-diabetic (p < 0.05) and type 1 diabetes (p < 0.01) individuals compared to baseline whereas BAP was increased (p < 0.05) with no difference observed in non-diabetic controls. There was a positive association between high circulating MDA and AIx (r2 = 0.611, p = 0.05), and between delta ROMs and delta AIx (r2 = 0.955, p = 0.014) in combined analysis of individuals with type 1 diabetes and non-diabetic controls. Type 1 diabetes individuals with varying status of DKD, showed elevated levels of ROMs in those with high HbA1c compared to their counterpart with low HbA1c (p < 0.05). Individuals with severe albuminuria showed elevated ROM levels (p < 0.01) and depressed antioxidant capacity (p < 0.01) compared to those with normal AER of comparable HbA1c concentrations. Conclusions: Biomarkers of oxidative stress are associated with vascular stiffness and DKD following acute and chronic hyperglycemic exposure and may provide added value to HbA1c in understanding disease pathology, predicting risk and assessing the status of secondary complications of type 1 diabetes. © The Author(s) 2024.","P.-H.

Methods: We included 2505 healthy controls based on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), 1736 unrelated T2D, and 1003 unrelated autoantibody-positive T1D individuals. Binary logistic regression was performed to evaluate the relationships between rs864745 in JAZF1 and T2D, T1D, and islet-specific autoantibody status under the additive model, while multiple linear regression was used to assess its effect on glycemic-related quantitative traits and plasma lipid levels. Results: We did not find any association between rs864745 in JAZF1 and T2D, T1D, or their subgroups (All P > 0.05). For glycemic traits, we found that the G allele of this variant was significantly associated with higher 120 min insulin level, insulinogenic index (IGI), corrected insulin response (CIR), and acute insulin response (BIGTT-AIR) (P = 0.033, 0.006, 0.009, and 0.016, respectively) in healthy individuals. Similar associations were observed in newly diagnosed T2D but not T1D individuals. Although this variant had no impact on islet autoimmunity (All P > 0.05), significant associations with plasma total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level stratified by JAZF1 rs864745 variant were observed in the disease status of T2D (P = 0.002 and 0.003) and T1D (P = 0.024 and 0.009), with significant heterogeneity to healthy individuals. Conclusions: The common JAZF1 rs864745 variant contributes to islet function and lipid metabolism, which might be put into genetic risk scores to assess the risk of related clinical features.

GAD65 autoantibodies (GADA) are associated with faster progression, but their predictive value is limited. We aimed to determine if a type 1 diabetes genetic risk score (T1D GRS) could predict rapid progression to insulin treatment over and above GADA testing. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We examined the relationship between T1D GRS, GADA (negative or positive), and rapid insulin requirement (within 5 years) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression in 8,608 participants with clinical type 2 diabetes (onset >35 years and treated without insulin for ‡6 months). T1D GRS was both analyzed continuously (as standardized scores) and categorized based on previously reported centiles of a population with type 1 diabetes (<5th [low], 5th–50th [medium], and >50th [high]). RESULTS In GADA-positive participants (3.3%), those with higher T1D GRS progressed to insulin more quickly: probability of insulin requirement at 5 years (95% CI): 47.9% (35.0%, 62.78%) (high T1D GRS) vs. 27.6% (20.5%, 36.5%) (medium T1D GRS) vs. 17.6% (11.2%, 27.2%) (low T1D GRS); P = 0.001. In contrast, T1D GRS did not predict rapid insulin requirement in GADA-negative participants (P = 0.4). In Cox regression analysis with adjustment for age of diagnosis, BMI, and cohort, T1D GRS was independently associated with time to insulin only in the presence of GADA: hazard ratio per SD increase was 1.48 (1.15, 1.90); P = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS A T1D GRS alters the clinical implications of a positive GADA test in patients with clinical type 2 diabetes and is independent of and additive to clinical features. © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.","A.G.

We report the case of a girl affected by PWS who presented at the age of 5.9 with premature pubarche, accelerated linear growth and advanced bone age (BA). She was subsequently diagnosed with non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) confirmed by genetic analysis. Considering the clinical, biochemical, and genetic findings, hydrocortisone therapy was started to prevent rapid BA acceleration and severe compromission of final height. During infancy, short stature and low levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) for age and gender led to suspicion of growth hormone deficiency (GHD), confirmed by stimulation testing (arginine and clonidine). rhGH therapy was administered and continued until final height was reached. During endocrinological follow up she developed impaired glucose tolerance with positive markers of β-cell autoimmunity (anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, GAD Ab), which evolved over time into type 1 diabetes mellitus and insulin therapy with a basal-bolus scheme and an appropriate diet were needed.

While the phenomenon of beta cell autoimmunity continues to be an active area of investigation, recent evidence suggests that beta cell stress responses are also important contributors to disease onset. Here we review the pathways driving different kinds of beta cell dysfunction and their respective therapeutic targets in the prevention of T1D. We discuss opportunities and important open questions around the effectiveness of beta cell therapies and challenges for clinical utility. We further evaluate ways in which beta cell drug therapy could be combined with immunotherapy for preventing T1D in light of our growing appreciation of disease heterogeneity and patient endotypes. Ultimately, the emergence of pharmacologic beta cell therapies for T1D have armed us with new tools and closing the knowledge gaps in T1D etiology will be essential for maximizing the potential of these approaches. © 2020 by the authors.

Atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, is approved for treatment of some types of advanced cancer. Its main treatment-related adverse events are immune related, such as thyroid dysfunction and hypophysitis. Autoimmune endocrinopathy can occur as isolated manifestations; only a few cases of autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes have been reported thus far. Case: We report a case of polyendocrine syndrome type 2, characterized by Addison disease (AD), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), accompanied by hypophysitis, in a patient treated with atezolizumab. Testing was positive for 21-hydroxylase and pituitary antibodies and negative for islet cells antibodies. HLA typing revealed DRB1∗04 and DQB1∗03 haplotypes, which are associated with increased susceptibility to T1DM and AD. Conclusion: The type and severity of immune-related adverse events in polyendocrine syndrome type 2 are different and depend on the monoclonal antibody used. Although the numerous molecular mechanisms inducing autoimmune endocrine diseases are still unclear, a link exists between HLA haplotypes, gene variants involved in immune checkpoint molecule expression, and increased susceptibility to autoimmune endocrinopathies. Additional studies are needed to identify susceptible patients and adapt therapy to each patient. © 2019 Endocrine Society.","I. Lupi; U.O.

Within this article, we review literature and data to build a knowledge base of Insulin (INS) genetics that influence transcription, transcript processing, translation, hormone maturation, secretion, receptor binding, and metabolism while highlighting the future needs of insulin research. The INS gene region has 2076 unique variants from population genetics. Several variants are found near the transcriptional start site, enhancers, and following the INS transcripts that might influence the readthrough fusion transcript INS–IGF2. This INS–IGF2 transcript splice site was confirmed within hundreds of pancreatic RNAseq samples, lacks drift based on human genome sequencing, and has possible elevated expression due to viral regulation within the liver. Moreover, a rare, poorly characterized African population-enriched variant of INS–IGF2 results in a loss of the stop codon. INS transcript UTR variants rs689 and rs3842753, associated with type 1 diabetes, are found in many pancreatic RNAseq datasets with an elevation of the 3′UTR alternatively spliced INS transcript. Finally, by combining literature, evolutionary profiling, and structural biology, we map rare missense variants that influence preproinsulin translation, proinsulin processing, dimer/hexamer secretory storage, receptor activation, and C-peptide detection for quasi-insulin blood measurements. © 2023 by the authors.","T.W.

Until now, patients in developing countries who had this condition had been misdiagnosed as having type 1 diabetes mellitus and accordingly directed to erroneous, ineffective, and costly therapeutic regimens. Objective: To detect Egyptian patients who harbor pathological variant in the KCNJ11 gene, so that their treatment regimen can be modified as needed to increase its effectiveness. Methods: We sequenced KCNJ11 in 17 ethnic Egyptian probands diagnosed with diabetes mellitus before age 2 years. Results: A preliminary case individual harboring a KCNJ11 pathological variant (p.R201H) was identified. The patient was successfully shifted from insulin therapy to sulfonylurea. Four previously identified benign variants, namely, E23K, I337V, L270V, and A190A, were detected in this patient. Conclusion: Implementing the findings of this molecular analysis could have a major clinical and nationwide economic impact on world health, especially in developing countries. © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

Mutation in genes namely ABCC8 and KCNJ11 disrupt the potentiality of KATP channel and regulates the secretion of insulin by detecting a change in the blood glucose level and consequently maintains glucose homeostasis. The present study was designed to investigate the association of ABCC8 and KCNJ11gene polymorphisms with type 1 diabetes. A case-control study was conducted enrolling 60 cases suffering from T1DM and 60 healthy controls of comparable age and sex. Gene variations were determined by PCR-RFLP and ARMS-PCR method. Results: The ABCC8-3C > T (rs1799854) variation was found to be significantly associated with T1DM (p<0.01) and “CT” genotype was found to be predominant in T1DM with a threefold increased risk to diabetes and the association was statistically significant. However, we did not find any significant association of C>T (rs1801261) polymorphism of ABCC8 with T1DM. A significant association was observed for genetic variation at rs5219 C>T polymorphism and the frequency of TT genotype was found to be significantly higher in patients (46.7%) than in controls (21.7%), indicating the significant role of the KCNJ11 rs5219 variant in T1DM susceptibility (p<0.001), but we did not observe any significant association of G>A (rs5215) polymorphism of KCNJ11 with T1DM. In addition, haplotype analysis of the two genes revealed four haplotypes such as T-C-G-T, T-C-A-T, C-C-G-T, and T-T-G-T as risk haplotypes for type 1 diabetes (p<0.02) potentially making individual effects of these variants on the disease susceptibility, thereby indicating the synergistic role of these genes in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Conclusions: The present study highlights the importance of personalized medicine based on individual genetic profile. © 2021, The Author(s).","V.

The loss of an aspartic acid at position 57 of diabetogenic HLA-DQβ chains supports this association; this single amino acid change influences how TCRs recognize peptides in the context of HLA-DQ8 and I-Ag7 using a mechanism termed the P9 switch. Here, we built register-specific insulin peptide MHC tetramers to examine CD4+ T cell responses to Ins12-20 and Ins13-21 peptides during the early prediabetic phase of disease in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. A single-cell analysis of anti-insulin CD4+ T cells performed in 6- and 12-week-old NOD mice revealed tissue-specific gene expression signatures. TCR signaling and clonal expansion were found only in the islets of Langerhans and produced either classical TH1 differentiation or an unusual Treg phenotype, independent of TCR usage. The early phase of the anti-insulin response was dominated by T cells specific for Ins12-20, the register that supports a P9 switch mode of recognition. The presence of the P9 switch was demonstrated by TCR sequencing, reexpression, mutagenesis, and functional testing of TCRαβ pairs in vitro. Genetic correction of the I-Aβ57 mutation in NOD mice resulted in the disappearance of D/E residues in the CDR3β of anti-Ins12-20 T cells. These results provide a mechanistic molecular explanation that links the characteristic MHC class II polymorphism of T1D with the recognition of islet autoantigens and disease onset.

Genetic and environmental predisposing factors contribute to the etiology of the disease, although their interaction is not sufficiently understood to allow for preventive action. Strongest known associations with genetic variation map to classical HLA class II genes. Because of its genetic complexity, the HLA region has been under-represented in genome-wide association studies, having potentially hindered the identification of relevant associations underlying the etiology of the disease. Here, we performed a comprehensive HLA-wide genetic association analysis of type 1 diabetes including multi-allelic and rare variants. We used high-density whole-exome sequencing data of the HLA region in the large UK Biobank dataset to apply gene-based association tests with a carefully defined type 1 diabetes phenotype (97 cases and 48,700 controls). Exon-based and single-variant association tests were used to complement the analysis. We replicated the known association of type 1 diabetes with the classical HLA-DQ gene. Tailoring the analysis toward rare variants, we additionally identified the lysine methyl transferase EHMT2 as associated. Deeper insight into genetic variation associated with disease as presented and discussed in detail here can help unraveling mechanistic details of the etiology of type 1 diabetes. More specifically, we hypothesize that genetic variation in EHMT2 could impact autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes development. © Copyright © 2021 Sticht, Álvaro-Benito and Konigorski.","J.

The complication of various autoimmune disorders is known as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS). Once autoimmune thyroid disease develops, various autoimmune diseases can also occur. Such phenomena are classified as APS types 3A to 3D. In this report, we show the onset of T1DM in a patient with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Sjogren’s syndrome. The most important and interesting point in this case is that, if we did not check her thyroid-associated antibodies, we could not have diagnosed her as APS. From the data of this case, we assumed that the patient suffered from APS type 3A, 3B, and 3D variants. This case pointed out very clearly the importance of testing for thyroid-associated antibodies under various autoimmune disease conditions even if the thyroid hormone levels are euthyroid. Moreover, based on the strong linkage between inflammatory bowel disease and T1DM and the compatibility with both T1DM and APS type 3, we think it is possible that Hashimoto’s disease is present under complicated conditions together with UC and T1DM. It would be important to repeatedly check for thyroid-associated antibodies even in euthyroid patients, especially under various autoimmune disease conditions.
